  As a software developer, I spend lots of time staring at a screen, which is why I make sure to prioritize my physical health and fitness. I love going to the gym and lifting weights to clear my head and stay in shape. Cycling and hiking are also favorite activities of mine, as they allow me to get out into nature and explore the world around me.

  When I'm not coding, I love experimenting with new recipes and cooking up a storm in the kitchen. Cooking is a form of creative expression for me, and I enjoy trying out new flavors and techniques. I also love spending a lazy afternoon curled up on the couch with a good movie, whether it's a classic or the latest blockbuster. And when winter rolls around, you'll find me hitting the slopes and snowboarding down the mountain. These interests help me maintain a balanced and fulfilling life outside of my work.
